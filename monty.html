            <p><b>Commonly carried bacteria: </b><br>
              Streptococcus viridans –  Endocarditis <br>
              Diphtheroids  Diphtheria <br>
              Anaerobes  Aspiration pneumonia, lung abcess, empyema <br>
              Neisseria spp. <br>
              <br>
              <b>Bacterial pathogens that can be carried asymptomatically:</b>
             <br> Neisseria meningitides – Meningococ meningitis, sepsis
             <br> Streptococcus pyogenes – Strep throat  RF and glomerulonephritis
             <br> Streptococcus pneumoniae – Meningitis and pneumonia
             <br> Haemophilus influenza – Meningitis and pneumonia esp COPD
             <br> Corynebacterium diphtheria - Diphtheria
            <br>  Moraxella catarrhalis – Pneumonia in COPD
              <br>
             <br> <b>Organisms associated with colonization as a result of antimicrobial therapy: All associated with HAP</b>
             <br> Klebsiella spp.
             <br> E. coli
             <br> Pseudomonas spp.
            <br> Candida albicans – mostly with prolonged ICU stay  invasive candidiasis
              <br>
             <br> Contamination: low number of organisms, often mixed populations
            <br>  Colonisation: higher number of organisms in the absence of symptoms and signs. May be mixed or pure cultures
             <br> Infection: high number of organisms, often single species dominates.

            <p>That’s right, yeah. I’ve had a team working on this over the past few weeks, and what we’ve come up with can be reduced to two fundamental concepts. One, people are not wearing enough hats. Two, matter is energy. In the Universe there are many energy fields which we cannot normally perceive. Some energies have a spiritual source which act upon a person’s soul. However, this soul does not exist ab initio as orthodox Christianity teaches; it has to be brought into existence by a process of guided self-observation. However, this is rarely achieved owing to man’s unique ability to be distracted from spiritual matters by everyday trivia.</p>
